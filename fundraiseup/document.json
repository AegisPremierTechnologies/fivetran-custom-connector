                "description": "This request helps you track updates and changes in your account in the same way as in the [Audit Log](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/audit-log/). While the `Donations` endpoint shows the current state of a donation when queried, it doesn't reflect changes that happen after the initial creation (for example, finalized fees or status updates). The `Events` endpoint logs all updates as they occur, giving you the most current view of activity when you query it.\n\n### Use cases\n- **Retrieving finalized fees**. The `platform_fee` field in a donation will initially show 0 until Stripe finalizes the fee data. To get the updated fee values, use the `Events` endpoint to track the `donation.success` event, which confirms that the finalized fees have been updated.\n- **Monitoring donation status changes**. Donations can move through multiple statuses — `pending`, `success`, `failed`, and more. Use the `Events` endpoint to track status changes. For example, a donation might be `pending` while awaiting payment processor confirmation and later transition to `success` or `failed`.\n- **Tracking refunds and disputes**. If a donation is refunded or disputed, you'll receive corresponding events like `donation.refunded`, `donation.success_dispute_created`, or `donation.success_dispute_won`. This helps keep your records accurate without manually checking each donation.\n- **Handling recurring plan updates**. Recurring donations generate events like `recurring_plan.activated`, `recurring_plan.failed`, or `recurring_plan.canceled`. Monitoring these events allows you to track subscription activities and take appropriate actions if a recurring payment fails or is canceled.\n- **Updating supporter information**. When a supporter updates their information or requests personal data deletion, events like `supporter.updated` or `supporter.personal_data_deleted` are triggered. This is especially important for maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.\n- **Monitoring tribute activity**. Use events like `tribute.created` or `tribute.updated` to keep track of tribute donations and ensure that tribute cards are sent as expected (`tribute.shared`).",

Fundraise Up complies with these standards, but if an organization or its vendor uses direct API integration with Stripe to send raw card data (such as card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes), that organization or vendor is responsible for meeting broader PCI DSS requirements, such as SAQ D for merchants or higher.\n\n When using [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), organizations remain responsible for PCI compliance, but the scope is reduced, typically to SAQ A, due to Stripe handling sensitive card data processing. If a third-party vendor manages card details (for example, in face-to-face or direct mail solutions), they must maintain their own PCI compliance (SAQ D or applicable), and the organization should document them as their third-party service provider.",

Use it to process offline donations through your Fundraise Up account and keep your CRM or other systems up to date with your fundraising activity.\n\nWith the API, you can interact with these resources:\n\n- Donations — Create and update donations and their associated recurring plans (within 24 hours of creation, API-created only).\n- Recurring plans — Read recurring donation schedules.\n- Supporters — Access supporter details.\n- Events — Retrieve events from your Audit Log.\n- Donor Portal access links — Authenticate supporters in the Donor Portal.\n- Donor Portal recurring plan access links — Provide direct access to recurring plan settings.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- The API does not support bulk updates — each request can only create or update one object.\n- Updates to Donations and Recurring plans are restricted to the first 24 hours and apply only to API-created donations.\n\n- You can retrieve and export data only for Donations, Recurring plans, Supporters, and Events.\n\n- The API supports card-based payment methods only: credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Other methods are not supported.\n\n## Key features\n\n- Architecture — Built on REST principles.\n- URLs — Provides predictable, resource-oriented URLs.\n- Requests — Accepts JSON-encoded request bodies with `Content-Type: application/json` header.\n- Responses — Returns JSON-encoded responses.\n- Standards — Uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\n## Use cases\n\nThere are a variety of use cases where you can integrate our API into your fundraising flow. In particular, you can use our API for:\n\n- Ticketing and events.\n- Face-to-face fundraising.\n- Direct mail campaigns.\n- Telefundraising.\n- Fundraising galas and dinners.\n- Analytics integrations.\n\nThe API is not intended for migrating subscriptions from legacy systems. For migration purposes, please refer to our [Migration service](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/migration/).\n\n## How to get API key\n\nTo use the Fundraise Up API, you first need to generate an API key. Only users with the [Organization Administrator](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/team-settings/#organization-administrator) role can create and manage API keys.\n\nFollow these steps to create your API key:\n\n1. Go to **[Dashboard](https://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/)** > **Settings** > **API keys**.\n\n2. Click **Create API key**.\n\n3. Enter a descriptive name for your API key. This name helps you identify different keys when you have multiple integrations.\n\n4. Choose the operating mode for your key:\n\n   - **Test data**: Use this mode to test your integration. You can later identify test mode keys by their `test_` prefix. They don't affect your live data or banking networks.\n\n   - **Live data**: Use this mode for processing real donations. Live mode keys have no prefix.\n\n5. Set permissions for this key by selecting at least one. You can modify these permissions later using the three-dot menu next to the key.\n\n   - **Retrieve donation data**: To access your organization's donation information.\n\n   - **Create new donations**: To process donations through your integration.\n\n   - **Retrieve fundraiser data**: To access supporter-created [Fundraisers](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/fundraiser/) linked to your campaigns.\n\n   - **Create new fundraisers**: To create Fundraiser records through your integration.\n\n   - **Generate Donor Portal access links**: To create secure [login links](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/seamless-donor-portal/) for your supporters.\n\n6. Click **Create API key**.\n\n7. Copy and securely store your API key. You will only see it once and cannot retrieve it later.\n\nYour key is activated immediately and does not expire.\n\n![Name.png](https://ucarecdn.com/91bd1878-cb29-47b4-8213-e4829cf149a1/api-1.png)\n\n## Managing API keys\n\nYou can view all your API keys on the [API keys page](http://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/settings/api-keys). For each key, click the three-dot menu to manage its settings. You can edit the key name, modify its permissions, or delete it if you no longer need it.\n\nIf you're using a third-party provider to manage your donations, they must have permission to create [Payment Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) entities in the same Stripe account as Fundraise Up.\n\n<p class=\"callout callout--danger\">If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, delete it immediately and generate a new key.</p>\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthenticate to the API using HTTP Bearer authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header like this: `curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer test_…\"`.\n\nEnsure that all API requests are made over HTTPS. Requests made over HTTP will not be accepted. Requests without proper authentication will also be rejected.\n\n## Parent accounts and subaccounts\n\nEach API key allows you to create donations only for the account to which it belongs. Parent accounts cannot create donations and generate [Donor Portal access links](https://fundraiseup.com/docs/seamless-donor-portal/) for subaccounts using their parent API key. To create donations for a subaccount, you need to generate an API key within that specific subaccount and use it.\n\nHowever, the parent account can still view and manage all API keys, including those for subaccounts. Additionally, a parent account's API key can export data for both the parent account and its subaccounts. This makes it easy to keep track of both API key activity and export data across the parent account and its subaccounts.\n\n![Parent accounts and subaccounts.png](https://ucarecdn.com/07b2584a-7a8d-43f9-9be6-832b02d2f04a/api-2.png)\n\n## Rate limits\n\nTo maintain stability and ensure reliable performance, the Fundraise Up API uses a concurrency-based request limit.\n\n### Concurrency limit\n\nEach account can send up to 3 API requests in parallel. This applies to all endpoints and all API keys associated with the same account, whether test or live.\n\nWhen more than 3 requests are sent in parallel, only 3 will be processed. Any additional requests will be rejected with a `429 Too Many Requests` error and the code `concurrent_requests_limit_exceeded`.\n\nTo avoid hitting the limit:\n\n- Keep your integration single-threaded and run requests sequentially — one after another.\n- If you use parallel requests, implement a queue to control concurrency.\n\n### Subaccounts\n\nThe limit applies to each account individually. Parent and subaccounts are counted separately. If your setup requires more parallel processing, you can distribute requests across multiple subaccounts.\n\n## Errors\n\nFundraise Up uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the outcome of an API request:\n\n- `2xx` codes indicate successful requests.\n- `4xx` codes indicate client-side errors, such as missing parameters or failed charges.\n- `5xx` codes, which are rare, indicate server-side issues with Fundraise Up.\n\nCertain 4xx errors, such as a [declined card](https://docs.stripe.com/declines), will include an error code with a brief explanation.\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\n| Code               | Status            | Explanation                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 200                | OK                | Everything worked as expected.                                                                                                            |\n| 400                | Bad Request       | The request was invalid, typically due to a missing required parameter.                                                                   |\n| 401                | Unauthorized      | No valid API key provided.                                                                                                                |\n| 403                | Forbidden         | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                                                              |\n| 404                | Not Found         | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                                                                     |\n| 409                | Conflict          | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.

(These are rare.)                                                                          |\n\n### Attributes\n\n- `code`**: nullable string.** Short error code for some errors that can be handled programmatically.\n- `message`**: nullable string.** Human-readable error description.\n- `parameter`**: nullable string.** Parameter associated with the error.\n- `stripe_error`**: nullable dictionary.** Stripe-specific error details (see [Stripe API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors).)\n\n### Error codes\n\n| Error code                           | Explanation                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `tokens_rate_limit_exceeded`         | Too many API tokens used within a time period.                  |\n| `requests_rate_limit_exceeded`       | Organization has reached the limit for API requests per period. |\n| `concurrent_requests_limit_exceeded` | Account has too many parallel requests.                         |\n| `stripe_rate_limit_exceeded`         | Too many requests made to Stripe.                               |\n| `stripe_error`                       | Error related to Stripe payment processing.                     |\n| `not_found`                          | Requested resource could not be found.                          |\n| `update_expired`                     | Update attempted after the allowed time period.                 |\n| `update_conflict`                    | The request conflicts with another request.                     |\n| `parameter_unexpected`               | Unexpected parameter provided in the request.                   |\n| `parameter_required`                 | Required parameter is missing from the request.                 |\n| `parameter_invalid`                  | Parameter provided is not valid.                                |\n| `payment_account_required`           | Payment account setup is necessary.                             |\n\nError codes may change over time. We'll update this article to reflect any changes.\n\n## Pagination\n\nAll API endpoints that list records display them in reverse chronological order and use cursor-based navigation for browsing through the list.\n\nTo maintain consistent sorting and navigation, especially when entities have the same creation date, records are also sorted by identifier in reverse alphabetical order. This means that records are first sorted by creation date (newest to oldest), and then by identifier (Z to A).\n\n| **Parameter**    | **Type**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `limit`          | **optional**, 10 by default | This parameter specifies the number of records to display per page, ranging from 1 to 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| `starting_after` | **optional object ID**      | A cursor for pagination. The `starting_after` parameter uses an existing object ID to define your position in the list. For example, if you fetch a list of items and receive 100 results, you can use the ID of the last object in that list as the `starting_after` parameter in your subsequent request to retrieve the next page of results.    |\n| `ending_before`  | **optional object ID**      | A cursor for pagination. The `ending_before` parameter uses an existing object ID to define your position in the list. For example, if you fetch a list of items and receive 100 results, you can use the ID of the first object in that list as the `ending_before` parameter in your subsequent request to retrieve the previous page of results. |\n\nThe parameters `starting_after` and `ending_before` are mutually exclusive.\n\n| **List response format** | **Type**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `data`                   | **array**   | An array containing the entity records, paginated by any request parameters.                                                                                                                           |\n| `has_more`               | **boolean** | Indicates whether there are more records available. For `starting_after`, it shows that there is a page with older records. For `ending_before`, it indicates that there is a page with newer records. |\n\n### How to get records for a specific date range\n\nThe API does not support date-based filtering through query parameters. To get records from a specific time period (for example, donations from December), you’ll need to:\n\n1. Use cursor-based pagination to fetch records in reverse chronological order:\n   ```\n   GET /v1/donations?limit=100\n   # Use the last donation ID from the response to get the next page\n   GET /v1/donations?limit=100&starting_after=LAST_DONATION_ID\n   ```\n2. Filter the records in your application by checking the `created_at` timestamp and keeping only those that fall within your target date range. Since records are returned from newest to oldest, you can stop paginating once you reach records older than your date range.\n\n## Request IDs\n\nEach API request includes response header `Request-Id` with unique value.\n\nTo help us resolve issues faster, please include the `Request-Id` when contacting us about a specific request.\n\n## Changes in API\n\nWe prioritize stability and compatibility in our API. We aim to make all changes backwards-compatible within the current version to avoid disrupting your existing workflows. If a change requires incompatibility, we will release a new API version.\n\nDetailed information about any changes will be posted on this page and added to the documentation.\n\n### July 2025\n\n#### Bank account details now included in payment object\n\nThe payment object in the `/v1/donations` response now includes a new `bank_account` object. This object is returned when the payment method is a bank transfer (such as ACH or SEPA Direct Debit) and includes a `last4` field with the last four digits of the bank account number.\n\nThis addition mirrors the existing `credit_card` object and provides more complete data for reconciliation and reporting. No changes are required on your end unless you wish to make use of the new field.\n\n#### New field: supporter_covered_fee_in_default_currency\n\nA new field, `supporter_covered_fee_in_default_currency`, has been added to the `/v1/donations` response. It represents the equivalent of `supporter_covered_fee` in the organization’s default currency, providing better clarity for cross-currency donations.\n\nThe description of `supporter_covered_fee` was also updated to clarify that the amount is in the donation’s currency.\n\n### June 2025\n\n#### New concurrency limit for API requests\n\nWe’ve updated how rate limits work in the API. Instead of per-second or per-minute thresholds, the API now enforces a concurrency-based limit: each account can have up to 3 active requests at the same time. If this limit is exceeded, additional requests are rejected with a `429 Too Many Requests` error.\n\n#### Automatic updates for supporter contact data\n\nThe address, phone, and employer fields in the `/v1/supporters` and `/v1/supporters/{id}` responses now reflect the latest data submitted through donations and recurring plans.\n\nTo track changes, use the `supporter.updated`, `donation.updated`, and `recurring_plan.details_updated` events from the `/v1/events endpoint`.\n\n### May 2025\n\n#### Expanded data in recurring_plan object\n\nThe `recurring_plan` object in the `/v1/donations` response now includes `created_at`, `ended_at`, and `next_installment_at` fields. This helps reduce the need for separate API calls to `/v1/recurring_plans/{id}`.\n\n### April 2025\n\n#### New endpoint: Fundraisers\n\nWe’ve added a new `fundraisers` endpoint to the API. This endpoint lets you create, update, and retrieve supporter-created Fundraisers linked to your campaigns.\n",
